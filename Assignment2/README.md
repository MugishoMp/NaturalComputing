how to run:
    You can fix this by running the function ioh.load_graph_problems() once in a 
    Python shell before you run the skeleton code. This should create a folder 
    named IOHExperimenter in your working directory. Once this folder exists, 
    you should be able to run the skeleton code without problems.
